# Swing Tracker

## Description

Swing tracker is an iOS/watchOS application for tracking and analyzing your tennis swing. This app was created as a summer project and is my first attempt at creating an app of any sort. Do not expect the application to be polished or feature-rich. Also,
its current ability to accuractly analyze swings is poor, though I plan on improving it in the future. For now, do not expect your tennis game to dramatically improve by using this app.

## Installation

To install and use Swing Tracker, a macOS device with Xcode 15.0+ is required. You will also need an iPhone/iPad (reccomended iOS 17.0+) and an Apple Watch with watchOS 8.0+ installed.

Installation Steps:

1. **Download the Repository:**
   - Click the "Code" button on the top right of the repository page on GitHub.
   - Select "Download ZIP" to download the project files to your computer.

2. **Unzip the Files:**
   - Locate the downloaded ZIP file and unzip it. This will create a folder with the project files.

3. **Open the Project in Xcode:**
   - Double-click on the `.xcodeproj` file within the unzipped folder. This will open the project in Xcode.

4. **Build and Run the Project:**
   - First, build the Swing Tracker iOS app on your mobile device.
   - Select the Swing Tracker Watch App scheme and build the companion app on your AppleWatch. Connecting your Apple Watch to Xcode can be difficult and may require you to disconnect and
   recconect your phone or watch multiple times.

## Usage and Features

1. To begin using the app, wear your Apple Watch on your dominant (forehand) arm. Open both the iOS app and the watch App.
2. On your watch app, press "Start Session" to begin a new session.
3. Start hitting! The app will automatically detect your swings. I reccomend doing 3-10 swings per session. When you are finished, press "Stop Session."
4. To view your sessions, press "My Sessions in the upper right-hand corner of the mobile app. The screen will populate with your sessions, labled by date. You can expand each session to reveal each swing.
5. Click on a swing to navigate to its designated interface. Each swing has its own 3D recreation, acceleration graph, racket face orientation graph, and estimated topspin indicator.
*NOTE:* The metrics for each swing will likely be somewhat innacurate, and more precise measurement
techniques will be developed. Furthermore, the app is best designed for analyzing forehands. Backhand analysis is a seperate challenge that will be a later focus.
